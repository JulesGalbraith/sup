<body id="gripGif">
<p id="poem1">

the reduction of body to viewport - erasure within a system that tallies and computes
a recognition that could never be such <br> i did not know it was skin between my lips until nerveless
biting flushed the cavity with warm metallic life <br>
we are paste and glue beings knowing completion in
the only layer that is not of us but binding <br>
as a plane is known for its flatness so we swell to fill the
space out of which we are interpolated
i found an entrance and a larger body my responsibilites now are always mutual
