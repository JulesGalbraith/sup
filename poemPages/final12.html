<body id="gripGif">
<p id="poem1">

the reduction of body to viewport - erasure within a system that tallies and computes
a recognition that could never be such i did not know it was skin between my lips until nerveless
biting flushed the cavity with warm metallic life we are paste and glue beings knowing completion in
the only layer that is not of us but binding as a flat face is known for its flatness so we swell to fill the
spaces between sample points elude the machine and be invisible
i was atomized but found an entrance and a larger body my responsibilites now are always collective
