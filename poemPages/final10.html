    embodiment will always be a challenge to utopia
    i have skin and warmth but it is not here with me now watch me project onto the nearest plane and make real infinity with the presence of
    just one more this magnetism stirs forms which batter and bulge against their containment limbs and digits plucked from the fray to present as whole apophenia redeemed and reified
    we had a kind of mass before shape begat our limits <br>were we given or extended
    there is a body that lives into the future
    it is excitation
