  <p id="poem1">

    before we were human we were feeling before we were persons we were pure absorption
    skin is symbolic in nature how do we create new skins to delimit all the ways in which we are
    escaping ourselves<br>
    i collected geometries burning for their simplicity only to be scraped across wild edges when i tried to lie with them
    i need love to be mappable assigned to thousands of locations creating a net creating the possibility of navigation creating a testament to having crossed a threshold
    that will not accept us whole
