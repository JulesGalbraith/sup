    before we were human we were feeling before we were persons we were pure absorption
    how to create new skins to delimit all the ways we
    escape ourselves<br>
    i collected geometries burning for simplicity to be scraped across wild edges when i tried to lie with them
    i need love to be mappable assigned to thousands of locations creating a net creating the possibility of navigation creating a testament <br>
    to a threshold that will not accept us whole
