unrest is a coating and impulse on the body<br>
 a container that is not
false but possible a breach visible once shifted into <br>
extracting the fungible
object i replace it <br>
the original becoming liquid the reserve remaining constant<br>
constancy as illusion the reserve came from liquid to become liquid<br>
settling for a moment in a pool known as safety <br>
ignoring source and
generation genesis as a practice in motion is unstable<br>
 stasis at a
later stage creating itself outside a body <br>
this i can hold a number to and call that number true
