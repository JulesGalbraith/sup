    We cannot withhold our faces any longer possibility rarefies and collapses
    what is sensed is brought in to become a contagion borne through perceptions and in expression
    the potential is a problem for the as-is, the solution one of transportation and shivering
     mediation makes lack into potential creates a ghost out of an elsewhere presence
    removals and absences an ethics of away <br>
    the body is never still or whole it is a creature of many bonds
