    We cannot withhold our faces any longer<br>
     possibility rarefies and collapses<br>
    our sensing invites a contagion borne through perceptible strands <br> in expression
    the potential is a problem for the as-is, the solution one of transit and shivering <br>
     mediation makes lack into perhaps creates a ghost out of an elsewhere <br>
    removals and absences an ethics of away <br>
    the body is never still or whole it is a creature of many bonds
